# Hack Computer Project

This repository contains implementations and projects from the **Nand2Tetris** course, where we build a fully functional Hack computer from the ground up using hardware design, assembly programming, and virtual machine implementation.

## Features
- **Logic Gates & Chips**: HDL implementations of basic and complex chips like multiplexers, ALUs, registers, and RAM.
- **Hack Assembly Programs**: Solutions for arithmetic operations, control flow, and graphics manipulation in Hack assembly.
- **Virtual Machine Implementation**: Translates high-level VM commands into Hack assembly language.
- **Hack CPU & Memory**: Full CPU and memory design to execute compiled programs.
- **Hack Computer**: A complete integration of all components into a working Hack computer.

## Projects Included
### 1. **Hardware Description Language (HDL)**
   - Basic gates: `And`, `Or`, `Not`.
   - Complex components: `ALU`, `RAM`, `Registers`, and the `CPU`.

### 2. **Assembler**
   - Hack assembly programs for solving computational problems:
     - Arithmetic (addition, subtraction).
     - Control flow (loops, conditions).

### 3. **Virtual Machine**
   - Implementation of the Hack VM with:
     - Memory segments (`argument`, `local`, `static`, etc.).
     - Control flow commands (`if-goto`, `goto`, etc.).
     - Function handling (`call`, `return`, etc.).

### 4. **High-Level Language Programs**
   - Example programs in Hack assembly:
     - Drawing rectangles and shapes.
     - Mathematical operations and algorithms.

## Purpose
This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to computer architecture and software-hardware integration, showcasing the process of building a computer from logic gates to a high-level programming platform.
